  <h1>This is a little bit about me</h1>
  <p>Hello, I am Andrew McLaughlin. I am from Piedmont California. I am a full time high school student. I am in 10th grade, and am 16 years old. I am a good student and play 2 sports: soccer and lacrosse. I enjoy spending time with others. My favorite sports team is the Pittsburgh Steelers. I plan to work locally this summer at summer camps.</p>
